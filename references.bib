	abstract = {The Farquhar–von Caemmerer–Berry (FvCB) model of photosynthesis is a change-point model and structurally overparameterized for interpreting the response of leaf net assimilation (A) to intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci). The use of conventional fitting methods may lead not only to incorrect parameters but also several previously unrecognized consequences. For example, the relationships between key parameters may be fixed computationally and certain fits may be produced in which the estimated parameters result in contradictory identification of the limitation states of the data. Here we describe a new approach that is better suited to the FvCB model characteristics. It consists of four main steps: (1) enumeration of all possible distributions of limitation states; (2) fitting the FvCB model to each limitation state distribution by minimizing a distribution-wise cost function that has desirable properties for parameter estimation; (3) identification and correction of inadmissible fits; and (4) selection of the best fit from all possible limitation state distributions. The new approach implemented theoretical parameter resolvability with numerical procedures that maximally use the information content of the data. It was tested with model simulations, sampled A/Ci curves, and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements of different tree species. The new approach is accessible through the automated website leafweb.ornl.gov.},

  Abstract                 = {Rising atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (Ca) can reduce stomatal conductance and transpiration rate in trees, but the magnitude of this effect varies considerably among experiments. The theory of optimal stomatal behaviour predicts that the ratio of photosynthesis to transpiration (instantaneous transpiration efficiency, ITE) should increase in proportion to Ca. We hypothesized that plants regulate stomatal conductance optimally in response to rising Ca. We tested this hypothesis with data from young Eucalyptus saligna Sm. trees grown in 12 climate-controlled whole-tree chambers for 2{\^{A}}{~}years at ambient and elevated Ca. Elevated Ca was ambient{\^{A}}{~}+{\^{A}}{~}240{\^{A}}{~}ppm, 60\% higher than ambient Ca. Leaf-scale gas exchange was measured throughout the second year of the study and leaf-scale ITE increased by 60\% under elevated Ca, as predicted. Values of leaf-scale ITE depended strongly on vapour pressure deficit (D) in both CO2 treatments. Whole-canopy CO2 and H2O fluxes were also monitored continuously for each chamber throughout the second year. There were small differences in D between Ca treatments, which had important effects on values of canopy-scale ITE. However, when Ca treatments were compared at the same D, canopy-scale ITE was consistently increased by 60\%, again as predicted. Importantly, leaf and canopy-scale ITE were not significantly different, indicating that ITE was not scale-dependent. Observed changes in transpiration rate could be explained on the basis that ITE increased in proportion to Ca. The effect of elevated Ca on photosynthesis increased with rising D. At high D, Ca had a large effect on photosynthesis and a small effect on transpiration rate. At low D, in contrast, there was a small effect of Ca on photosynthesis, but a much larger effect on transpiration rate. If shown to be a general response, the proportionality of ITE with Ca will allow us to predict the effects of Ca on transpiration rate.},

  Abstract                 = {The Ball{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblleft}Berry stomatal conductance model is commonly used in earth system models to simulate biotic regulation of evapotranspiration. However, the dependence of stomatal conductance (gs) on vapor pressure deficit (Ds) and soil moisture must be empirically parameterized. We evaluated the Ball{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblleft}Berry model used in the Community Land Model version 4.5 (CLM4.5) and an alternative stomatal conductance model that links leaf gas exchange, plant hydraulic constraints, and the soil{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblleft}plant{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblleft}atmosphere continuum (SPA). The SPA model simulates stomatal conductance numerically by (1) optimizing photosynthetic carbon gain per unit water loss while (2) constraining stomatal opening to prevent leaf water potential from dropping below a critical minimum. We evaluated two optimization algorithms: intrinsic water-use efficiency ({\^{I}}{\textquotedblright}An /{\^{I}}{\textquotedblright}gs, the marginal carbon gain of stomatal opening) and water-use efficiency ({\^{I}}{\textquotedblright}An /{\^{I}}{\textquotedblright}El, the marginal carbon gain of transpiration water loss). We implemented the stomatal models in a multi-layer plant canopy model to resolve profiles of gas exchange, leaf water potential, and plant hydraulics within the canopy, and evaluated the simulations using leaf analyses, eddy covariance fluxes at six forest sites, and parameter sensitivity analyses. The primary differences among stomatal models relate to soil moisture stress and vapor pressure deficit responses. Without soil moisture stress, the performance of the SPA stomatal model was comparable to or slightly better than the CLM Ball{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblleft}Berry model in flux tower simulations, but was significantly better than the CLM Ball{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblleft}Berry model when there was soil moisture stress. Functional dependence of gs on soil moisture emerged from water flow along the soil-to-leaf pathway rather than being imposed a priori, as in the CLM Ball{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblleft}Berry model. Similar functional dependence of gs on Ds emerged from the {\^{I}}{\textquotedblright}An/{\^{I}}{\textquotedblright}El optimization, but not the {\^{I}}{\textquotedblright}An /gs optimization. Two parameters (stomatal efficiency and root hydraulic conductivity) minimized errors with the SPA stomatal model. The critical stomatal efficiency for optimization ({\^{I}}\textsuperscript{1}) gave results consistent with relationships between maximum An and gs seen in leaf trait data sets and is related to the slope (g1) of the Ball{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblleft}Berry model. Root hydraulic conductivity (Rr*) was consistent with estimates from literature surveys. The two central concepts embodied in the SPA stomatal model, that plants account for both water-use efficiency and for hydraulic safety in regulating stomatal conductance, imply a notion of optimal plant strategies and provide testable model hypotheses, rather than empirical descriptions of plant behavior.},

  Abstract                 = {Crown carbon gain is maximized for a given total water loss if stomatal conductance (gs) varies such that the marginal carbon product of water ($\partial$A/$\partial$E) remains invariant both over time and among leaves in a plant crown, provided the curvature of assimilation rate (A) versus transpiration rate (E) is negative. We tested this prediction across distinct crown positions in situ for the first time by parameterizing a biophysical model across 14 positions in four grapevine crowns (Vitis vinifera), computing optimal patterns of gs and E over a day and comparing these to the observed patterns. Observed water use was higher than optimal for leaves in the crown interior, but lower than optimal in most other positions. Crown carbon gain was 18\% lower under measured gs than under optimal gs. Positive curvature occurred in 39.6\% of cases due to low boundary layer conductance (gbw), and optimal gs was zero in 11\% of cases because $\partial$A/$\partial$E was below the target value at all gs. Some conclusions changed if we assumed infinite gbw, but optimal and measured E still diverged systematically in time and space. We conclude that the theory's spatial dimension and assumption of positive curvature require further experimental testing.},

  Abstract                 = {Stomatal conductance (gs) affects the fluxes of carbon, energy and water between the vegetated land surface and the atmosphere. We test an implementation of an optimal stomatal conductance model within the Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange (CABLE) land surface model (LSM). In common with many LSMs, CABLE does not differentiate between gs model parameters in relation to plant functional type (PFT), but instead only in relation to photosynthetic pathway. We constrained the key model parameter "g1", which represents plant water use strategy, by PFT, based on a global synthesis of stomatal behaviour. As proof of concept, we also demonstrate that the g1 parameter can be estimated using two long-term average (1960{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblleft}1990) bioclimatic variables: (i) temperature and (ii) an indirect estimate of annual plant water availability. The new stomatal model, in conjunction with PFT parameterisations, resulted in a large reduction in annual fluxes of transpiration ({\textasciitilde} 30\% compared to the standard CABLE simulations) across evergreen needleleaf, tundra and C4 grass regions. Differences in other regions of the globe were typically small. Model performance against upscaled data products was not degraded, but did not noticeably reduce existing model{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblleft}data biases. We identified assumptions relating to the coupling of the vegetation to the atmosphere and the parameterisation of the minimum stomatal conductance as areas requiring further investigation in both CABLE and potentially other LSMs. We conclude that optimisation theory can yield a simple and tractable approach to predicting stomatal conductance in LSMs.},

  Abstract                 = {Leaf transpiration rate (E) frequently shows a peaked response to increasing vapour pressure deficit (D). The mechanisms for the decrease in E at high D, known as the {\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textasciitilde}apparent feed-forward response{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\texttrademark}, are strongly debated but explanations to date have exclusively focused on hydraulic processes. However, stomata also respond to signals related to photosynthesis. We investigated whether the apparent feed-forward response of E to D in the field can be explained by the response of photosynthesis to temperature (T), which normally co-varies with D in field conditions. As photosynthesis decreases with increasing T past its optimum, it may drive a decrease in stomatal conductance (gs) that is additional to the response of gs to increasing D alone. If this additional decrease is sufficiently steep and coupling between A and gs occurs, it could cause an overall decrease in E with increasing D. We tested this mechanism using a gas exchange model applied to leaf-scale and whole-tree {CO}2 and H2O fluxes measured on Eucalyptus saligna growing in whole-tree chambers. A peaked response of E to D was observed at both leaf and whole-tree scales. We found that this peaked response was matched by a gas exchange model only when T effects on photosynthesis were incorporated. We conclude that field-based studies of the relationship between E and D need to consider signals related to changing photosynthetic rates in addition to purely hydraulic mechanisms.},

  Abstract                 = {Gas-exchange measurements on Eucalyptus grandis leaves and data extracted from the literature were used to test a semi-empirical model of stomatal conductance for {CO}2, g(sc)=g(0)+a(1)A/[(c(s)-Gamma) (1+D-s/D-0)], where A is the assimilation rate; D-s and c(s) are the humidity deficit and the {CO}2 concentration at the leaf surface, respectively; g(0) is the conductance as A--{\textgreater}0 when leaf irradiance --{\textgreater}0; and D-0 and a(1) are empirical coefficients. This model is a modified version of g(sc)=a(1)A h(s)/c(s) first proposed by Ball, Woodrow \& Berry (1987, in Progress in Photosynthesis Research, Martinus Mijhoff, Publ., pp. 221-224), in which h(s) is relative humidity. Inclusion of the {CO}2 compensation point, Gamma, improved the behaviour of the model at low values of c(s), while a hyperbolic function of D-s for humidity response correctly accounted for the observed hyperbolic and linear variation of g(sc) and c(i)/c(s) as a function of D-s, where c(i) is the intercellular {CO}2 concentration. In contrast, use of relative humidity as the humidity variable led to predictions of a linear decrease in g(sc) and a hyperbolic variation in c(i)/c(s) as a function of D-s, contrary to data from E. grandis leaves. The revised model also successfully described the response of stomata to variations in A, D-s and c(s) for published responses of the leaves of several other species, Coupling of the revised stomatal model with a biochemical model for photosynthesis of C-3 plants synthesizes many of the observed responses of leaves to light, humidity deficit, leaf temperature and {CO}2 concentration. Best results are obtained for well-watered plants.},

Mass balance equations for the time dependence of H2O and CO2 mol fractions within the leaf chamber were used to describe instrument function. Measurements for each run were fitted to an exponential function to estimate average rates of CO2 assimilation and transpiration during the measurement period. Stomatal conductances and intercellular CO2 mol fractions were also computed. Linear data analysis used in the LI-6200 produced similar results for assimilation rates, stomatal conductances and intercellular CO2 concentrations compared to a more rigorous nonlinear analysis, provided humidity within the chamber was kept constant during the measurement period. Instrument performance for CO2 fluxes was confirmed by injecting pure CO2 at steady rates from a microsyringe into the chamber. Miniature evaporimeters were designed to check H2O flux measurements. Significant discrepancies were observed between LI-6200 estimates of H2O fluxes and direct measurement and errors were attributed to adsorption desorption of water vapour on chamber walls or to leaks. The leaf chamber should be stored at humidities and temperatures similar to those during measurement conditions for maximum reliability of results.},

  Abstract                 = {Stomatal conductance (gs) is a key land-surface attribute as it links transpiration, the dominant component of global land evapotranspiration, and photosynthesis, the driving force of the global carbon cycle. Despite the pivotal role of gs in predictions of global water and carbon cycle changes, a global-scale database and an associated globally applicable model of gs that allow predictions of stomatal behaviour are lacking. Here, we present a database of globally distributed gs obtained in the field for a wide range of plant functional types (PFTs) and biomes. We find that stomatal behaviour differs among PFTs according to their marginal carbon cost of water use, as predicted by the theory underpinning the optimal stomatal model and the leaf and wood economics spectrum. We also demonstrate a global relationship with climate. These findings provide a robust theoretical framework for understanding and predicting the behaviour of gs across biomes and across PFTs that can be applied to regional, continental and global-scale modelling of ecosystem productivity, energy balance and ecohydrological processes in a future changing climate.},

  Abstract                 = {The response of photosynthesis to temperature is a central facet of plant response to climate. Such responses have been found to be highly variable among species and among studies. Understanding this variability is key when trying to predict the effects of rising global temperatures on plant productivity. There are three major factors affecting the response of leaf net photosynthesis to temperature (An{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblleft}T): (i) photosynthetic biochemistry, (ii) respiration and (iii) vapour pressure deficit (D) and stomatal sensitivity to vapour pressure deficit during measurements. The overall goal of our study was to quantify the relative contribution of each of these factors in determining the response of An to temperature. We first conducted a sensitivity analysis with a coupled photosynthesis{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblleft}stomatal (An{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblleft}gs) model, using ranges for parameters of each factor taken from the literature, and quantified how these parameters affected the An{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblleft}T response. Second, we applied the An{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblleft}gs model to two example sets of field data, which had different optimum temperatures (Topt) of An, to analyse which factors were most important in causing the difference. We found that each of the three factors could have an equally large effect on Topt of An. In our comparison between two field datasets, the major cause for the difference in Topt was not the biochemical component, but rather the differences in respiratory components and in D conditions during measurements. We concluded that shifts in An{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblleft}T responses are not always driven by acclimation of photosynthetic biochemistry, but can result from other factors. The D conditions during measurements and stomatal responses to D also need to be quantified if we are to better understand and predict shifts in An{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblleft}T with climate.},

  Abstract                 = {The principles, equipment and procedures for measuring leaf and canopy gas exchange have been described previously as has chlorophyll fluorescence. Simultaneous measurement of the responses of leaf gas exchange and modulated chlorophyll fluorescence to light and CO2 concentration now provide a means to determine a wide range of key biochemical and biophysical limitations on photo synthesis in vivo. Here the mathematical frameworks and practical procedures for determining these parameters in vivo are consolidated. Leaf CO2 uptake (A) versus intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) curves may now be routinely obtained from commercial gas exchange systems. The potential pitfalls, and means to avoid these, are examined. Calculation of in vivo maximum rates of ribulose{\^{a}}{\texteuro}�1,5{\^{a}}{\texteuro}�bisphosphate (RuBP) carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) carboxylation (Vc,max), electron transport driving regeneration of RuBP (Jmax), and triose{\^{a}}{\texteuro}�phosphate utilization (VTPU) are explained; these three parameters are now widely assumed to represent the major limitations to light{\^{a}}{\texteuro}�saturated photosynthesis. Precision in determining these in intact leaves is improved by the simultaneous measurement of electron transport via modulated chlorophyll fluorescence. The A/Ci response also provides a simple practical method for quantifying the limitation that stomata impose on CO2 assimilation. Determining the rate of photorespiratory release of oxygen (Rl) has previously only been possible by isotopic methods, now, by combining gas exchange and fluorescence measurements, Rl may be determined simply and routinely in the field. The physical diffusion of CO2 from the intercellular air space to the site of Rubisco in C3 leaves has long been suspected of being a limitation on photosynthesis, but it has commonly been ignored because of the lack of a practical method for its determination. Again combining gas exchange and fluorescence provides a means to determine mesophyll conductance. This method is described and provides insights into the magnitude and basis of this limitation.},

Modelling of stomatal conductance was a key discussion topic at the workshop held in honour of Ray Leuning's retirement. In this note, we compare two recently published alternative models derived from optimal stomatal theory (Katul et al., 2010; Medlyn et al., 2011). We show that stomatal behaviour clearly departs from that predicted by optimal stomatal theory when Rubisco activity is limiting to photosynthesis. There are two possible alternative interpretations of this observation: either the stomatal behaviour is not optimal, or else the optimisation problem is incorrectly specified. We show that the alternative models effectively follow these alternative interpretations, and consider the implications for our understanding of stomatal behaviour.},

  Abstract                 = {Physiological plant ecology is primarily concerned with the function and performance of plants in their environment. Within this broad focus, attempts are made on one hand to understand the underlying physiological, biochemical and molecular attributes of plants with respect to performance under the constraints imposed by the environment. On the other hand physiological ecology is also concerned with a more synthetic view which attempts to under stand the distribution and success of plants measured in terms of the factors that promote long-term survival and reproduction in the environment. These concerns are not mutually exclusive but rather represent a continuum of research approaches. Osmond et al. (1980) have elegantly pointed this out in a space-time scale showing that the concerns of physiological ecology range from biochemical and organelle-scale events with time constants of a second or minutes to succession and evolutionary-scale events involving communities and ecosystems and thousands, if not millions, of years. The focus of physiological ecology is typically at the single leaf or root system level extending up to the whole plant. The time scale is on the order of minutes to a year. The activities of individual physiological ecologists extend in one direction or the other, but few if any are directly concerned with the whole space-time scale. In their work, however, they must be cognizant both of the underlying mechanisms as well as the consequences to ecological and evolutionary processes.},

Over the last 20 years, these parameterizations have evolved from simple, unrealistic schemes into credible representations of the global soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer system as advances in plant physiological and hydrological research, advances in satellite data interpretation, and the results of large-scale field experiments have been exploited. Some modern schemes incorporate biogeochemical and ecological knowledge and, when coupled with advanced climate and ocean models, will be capable of modeling the biological and physical responses of the Earth system to global change, for example, increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide.},

  Abstract                 = {Photosynthetic responses to carbon dioxide concentration can provide data on a number of important parameters related to leaf physiology. Methods for fitting a model to such data are briefly described. The method will fit the following parameters: Vcmax, J, TPU, Rd and gm[maximum carboxylation rate allowed by ribulose 1{\^{A}}$\cdot$5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), rate of photosynthetic electron transport (based on NADPH requirement), triose phosphate use, day respiration and mesophyll conductance, respectively]. The method requires at least five data pairs of net CO2 assimilation (A) and [CO2] in the intercellular airspaces of the leaf (Ci) and requires users to indicate the presumed limiting factor. The output is (1) calculated CO2 partial pressure at the sites of carboxylation, Cc, (2) values for the five parameters at the measurement temperature and (3) values adjusted to 25{\^{A}}{~}{\^{A}}$\deg$C to facilitate comparisons. Fitting this model is a way of exploring leaf level photosynthesis. However, interpreting leaf level photosynthesis in terms of underlying biochemistry and biophysics is subject to assumptions that hold to a greater or lesser degree, a major assumption being that all parts of the leaf are behaving in the same way at each instant.},

The spectrum runs from quick to slow return on investments of nutrients and dry mass in leaves, and operates largely independently of growth form, plant functional type or biome. Categories along the spectrum would, in general, describe leaf economic variation at the global scale better than plant functional types, because functional types overlap substantially in their leaf traits. Overall, modulation of leaf traits and trait relationships by climate is surprisingly modest, although some striking and significant patterns can be seen. Reliable quantification of the leaf economics spectrum and its interaction with climate will prove valuable for modelling nutrient fluxes and vegetation boundaries under changing land-use and climate.},

  Abstract                 = {Species-specific differences in the assimilation of atmospheric CO2 depends upon differences in the capacities for the biochemical reactions that regulate the gas-exchange process. Quantifying these differences for more than a few species, however, has proven difficult. Therefore, to understand better how species differ in their capacity for CO2 assimilation, a widely used model, capable of partitioning limitations to the activity of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase, to the rate of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate regeneration via electron transport, and to the rate of triose phosphate utilization was used to analyse 164 previously published A/Ci, curves for 109 C3 plant species. Based on this analysis, the maximum rate of carboxylation, Vcmax, ranged from 6$\mu$mol m$-$2 s$-$1 for the coniferous species Picea abies to 194$\mu$mol m$-$2 s$-$1 for the agricultural species Beta vulgaris, and averaged 64$\mu$mol m$-$2 s$-$1 across all species. The maximum rate of electron transport, Jmax, ranged from 17$\mu$mol m$-$2 s$-$1 again for Picea abies to 372$\mu$mol m$-$2 s$-$1 for the desert annual Malvastrum rotundifolium, and averaged 134$\mu$mol m$-$2 s$-$1 across all species. A strong positive correlation between Vcmax and Jmax indicated that the assimilation of CO2 was regulated in a co-ordinated manner by these two component processes. Of the A/Ci curves analysed, 23 showed either an insensitivity or reversed-sensitivity to increasing CO2 concentration, indicating that CO2 assimilation was limited by the utilization of triose phosphates. The rate of triose phosphate utilization ranged from 4$\cdot$9 $\mu$mol m$-$2 s$-$1 for the tropical perennial Tabebuia rosea to 20$\cdot$1 $\mu$mol m$-$2 s$-$1 for the weedy annual Xanthium strumarium, and averaged 10$\cdot$1 $\mu$mol m$-$2 s$-$1 across all species.Despite what at first glance would appear to be a wide range of estimates for the biochemical capacities that regulate CO2 assimilation, separating these species-specific results into those of broad plant categories revealed that Vcmax and Jmax were in general higher for herbaceous annuals than they were for woody perennials. For annuals, Vcmax and Jmax averaged 75 and 154 $\mu$mol m$-$2 s$-$1, while for perennials these same two parameters averaged only 44 and 97 $\mu$mol m$-$2 s$-$1, respectively. Although these differences between groups may be coincidental, such an observation points to differences between annuals and perennials in either the availability or allocation of resources to the gas-exchange process.},
